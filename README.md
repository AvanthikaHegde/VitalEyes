This repository contains the VitalEyes project code, 
specifically the DeepFace module responsible for real-time emotion detection. 
It also includes the integration with Supabase, allowing seamless storage and management of detected emotions and related data.

The requirements are that the user needs to install deepface -v 0.0.95
and also create their own API keys from supabase
